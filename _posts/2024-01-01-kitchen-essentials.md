This is a collection of tools you'll need in the kitchen to get started. These are things that should be found in any kitchen and if you're just starting out, do yourself a favor and use this list to fill out all you need.

Sure, you can find this all on Amazon, but they suck. Look around for a local shop and support your neighbors.

## A good pan
Avoid anything "Non-stick" because they're filled with toxins. Cast iron, Stainless steel, and Ceramic are all good options but take some practice to cook with. While it's not as easy to cook with than a non-stick pan, a good pan will last you a lifetime.

## Dutch Oven
A dutch oven is great for meals that need to cook for longer. Find one that can fit in your oven so you can use it to cook roasts and even bread. Just like the pans, cast iron or enamel are the way to go for a dutch oven that will outlive you.

## A good knife
You're going to do a lot of chopping so make sure you have a good quality knife. You don't need a whole fancy set, just a simple versatile knife will get the job done. You will instantly notice the difference between a good and bad knife so don't be cheap.



## Cutting Board
When it comes to cutting boards, avoid the plastic ones. Everytime you make a chop, you're cutting a bunch of micro-plastics that end up in your body. Get yourself two wooden chopping boards, one for veggies and one for meats (**never mix them**). They should last you a while and are relatively afforable.



## Wooden spoons
There's a ton of fancy spatulas and tongs out there, but you don't need to drop $50 on something you use to push around your food. Wooden spoons have been around forever and as long as you take care of them, they'll last you forever.



## Rice cooker
You can make it on your own, but honestly, why bother? A rice cooker will make your life easier and free you up to focus on the main dish. There's a bunch of affordable options out there.



## Blender or Food processor
You'll be making a ton of [Sofrito](/holy-trinity) and you'll want to have something to chop stuff up easily. Do yourself a favor and find something that's versatile so you can use it for a bunch of different things. Handmixers can also work well in a pinch, but a good food processor will go a long way in the kitchen.



## Apron
Things are going to splatter and you don't wanna get stains. If not, you'll need to use Marta's baking soda trick. 



## Molcajete
Definitely a luxury, a good molcajete is perfect for grinding spices or even creating salsas and guacamole. Make sure you get one made of volcanic stone and look for imperfections. Anything with chips or uneven edges means it's legit. Don't forget to cure it before use [^two].
