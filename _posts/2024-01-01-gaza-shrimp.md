## Instructions

### Prep work
1. If the shrimp need to be cleaned and peeled, do that first so they are ready to toss in
2. In a dry small pan, toast the **sesame seeds** over medium heat. This will only take a few minutes until they turn light brown. Take them off the heat and set them aside
3. Slice the **red onion**. You don't want to use the food processor here because you don't want a paste, you want it to retain some shape.
4. Wash and chop up the tomatoes into small chunks. Again, you don't want it to be a paste, it will break down when it cooks.
5. Combine **1/2 teaspoon of salt**, **1/2 teaspoon of pepper**, **cumin**, **allspice**, and **caraway seeds** in a small bowl and set aside
6. Start boiling **200ml (3/4 cup) of water**, you'll need it once you start cooking the tomatoes

### Preparation

1. Over medium heat with **olive oil**, fry the **onions** for about 10 minutes
2. Add the chopped **tomatoes** along with the **sugar**, the **dry spice mix** you prepped, along with **200ml (3/4 cup) of your just boiled water**
3. While that cooks for a bit, small the **garlic**, **dill**, **1/2 teaspoon of salt**, and **green chilis** in your food processor until it's well blended. Put that mix in with the cooking tomatoes 
4. Cover and **cook on low for about 20 minutes**
5. After 20 minutes, uncover and toss your cleaned **shrimp** in. Make sure they get submerged in the tomatoes so that they cook evenly. Cook them for about 2-4 minutes or until they turn pink.
6. Turn off the heat and drizzle some **olive oil** and your chopped **parsley** on top and serve.


This goes great with some toasted bread or over some white rice.
