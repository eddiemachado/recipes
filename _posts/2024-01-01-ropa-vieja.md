### Instructions:

Marta's recipe:
Hi Macho, you have to buy skirt steak- do you have a pressure cooker? If so, cover the meat with water, 1 tablespoon of salt, one packet of Goya seasoning, half of onion, half of pepper.  Cook it for 20 minutes. Let it cool and shred the meat. Then you do a sofrito with onion, pepper, garlic in olive oil. Add tomato sauce, and white wine and you can add the consomé that you cooked the meat with. Bon appetite
