Growing up on weekends, breakfast at the Vila house was always the best. Paco would make a run to the [Farm Stores] and pick up some [[The Farm store]] and we'd pair it with some Ovaltine. 

I was always more of a [Tang] kid, but Franky and Paco would load up on Ovaltine. As a kid, it always felt like the ratio of powder to milk was 50/50. It was as thick as a milkshake.
