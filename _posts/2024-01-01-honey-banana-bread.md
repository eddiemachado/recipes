If you've got bananas that have turned mushy and brown, don't throw them out, make some banana bread. This recipe doesn't have sugar and it relies on using high quality honey. This means the better the honey you use, the better the taste. 

Most honey in supermarkets is filtered or cut[^one] with brown sugar so there's not even actual pollen[^two] in it. Buy local raw honey at the farmers market to ensure you're getting the good stuff[^three].

## Instructions

### Prep work
1. Preheat the oven to **250째F (175째C)**
2. Take a tin or small pan and rub it well with butter. This prevents the sides from sticking so it will pop out easier
3. In a bowl, combine the **flour**, **baking soda**, and **salt** and mix. It's important to mix these before to make sure there are no dry or salty chunks in the finished bread.

### Preparation

1. Mix the **butter** and **honey** in a mixer or bowl until it's well mixed
2. Add the **eggs** one by one and mix well
3. Add the **bananas** in one at a time and mix well
4. You want to do this next bit by hand. Pour the **dry ingredients** into the your bowl with the mixture. Fold it slowly and not too hard until it's all mixed together. This keeps the bread fluffy and airy.
5. Pour the mixture into your previously greased pan and put it into the oven at **250째F (175째C)**
6. Cook for about **50 - 55 minutes**, then stick a toothpick into the center. If it comes out totally clean, then it's ready. You can take it out of the oven.
7. Let it cool for in the pan for 10 minutes then take it out and let it cool for a bit longer before cutting into it.




This banana bread will last around 2 - 3 days if you keep it covered or in a container. You don't need to keep it in the fridge.
