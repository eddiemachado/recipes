Each culture has their own holy trinity. The base in which most meals are cooked. 

- Celery, Carrots, Onion (battuto)

- Garlic, Onion, Green or Red Bell Pepper (sofrito)

- Garlic, Onion, Green Bell Pepper (cuban sofrito)

The addition of Garlic is usually called the pope.

Sofrito is the holy trinity cooked in olive oil.

In cuisines around the world, most recipes start with a foundation called the [Holy Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cooking)). In Italy, they call it [Battuto](https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/odori-battuto-soffritto), in Haiti, they call it [Epis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epis), In France, they call it [Mirepoix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix) and in Latin American countries, we call it Sofrito.

[Sofrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofrito) can vary from kitchen to kitchen and recipe to recipe, but it usually consists of:
- Garlic
- Yellow [[Onions]]
- Green Bell Peppers

Some people will add Roma tomatoes, Cumin, Oregano, and use vegtable oil instead of olive oil.

Some people also use [Aj√≠ Dulce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aj%C3%AD_dulce) instead of Green Bell Peppers.

You can store sofrito for about a week pre-made if you like, but I find it's best to just make it fresh, because if you have a [[food processor]], it takes seconds to create.



If you're making italian food or [[Javi's Penne Pasta]], you'll want to use a base of battuto. This is a mix of carrots, celery, and onions. You can toss in Garlic and this is referred to as The Pope. This is a good way to make some simple at home pasta sauce that is simple and way healthier than the store bought shit.
