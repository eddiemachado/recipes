In cuisines around the world, most recipes start with a foundation called the [Holy Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cooking)). In Italy, they call it Battuto [^one]. In Haiti, they call it Epis [^two]. In France, they call it Mirepoix [^three]. In Latin American countries, we call it Sofrito.


## Battuto
Celery • Carrots • Onions

When cooking Italian dishes like (Javi's Penne Pasta)[], you can create a solid base using Celery, Carrots, and Onions. The optional addition of Garlic is considered adding the Pope. Chop them up and simmer the mix in Olive Oil for about 5-10 minutes before you start throwing the rest of your ingredients in. It's a much healthier and tastier way to create pasta sauce than store bought options.

## Epis
Garlic • Scallions • Parsley • Thyme • Lemon juice • Scotch bonnet peppers
{: class="light section-byline"}
The foundation to most Hatian meals, Epis is less of a Trinity but functions the same. In some versions, people use vinegar instead of lemon juice [^four], it just depends on your taste.  In combination with the Scotch bonnet peppers [^five], others also add Jabanero peppers to add that extra kick [^six] Hatian food is known for.


## Cuban Sofrito
Garlic • Green bell peppers • Yellow onions
{: class="light section-byline"}
There are very few variations of a classic Sofrito. In most cases, you should always use Yellow Onions and Garlic. Some people use exclusively Green bell peppers, while others use a mix of red and green. Others add a bit of Cumin or Oregano [^seven], but I reccomend avoiding that and just using Adobo instead. Because this is a base, you don't want it to be too complex, otherwise every recipe you make will taste similar.


You can store sofrito for about a week pre-made if you like, but I find it's best to just make it fresh, because if you have a food processor, it takes seconds to create.
