You're going to make a lot of rice in your life. It goes with everything and it's very easy to make. It's often one of the first thing people learn how to cook. These days, everyone has a rice cooker, which makes things way easier. Growing up, I remember abuela Clarissa making it in a big tin pot. It was beat up and massive, but she always managed to get the flavor just right.

White rice is very versatile and you can make a bunch and save it for days.


### Rice in the microwave
My dad makes his rice in the microwave. Sure, this works fine, but would you rather eat a (metaphor).


To get the perfect white rice, you'll want a 2/1 ratio of water to rice. In most asian kitchens, they say, you check the water level with your knuckle on your index finger. This usually works nicely.

If you want to add a little flavor to your rice, add a bay leaf in while it cooks. 

If you want, you can also cook your rice with [[Sofrito]] to give it a bit of flavor. Just be sure to cook the sofrito and then toss the rice in to let it cook a bit, then pour the water in to let it cook. That way it will taste better.
