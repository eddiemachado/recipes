### Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 pounds flank steak
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 2 limes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh chopped cilantro or parsley for garnish (optional)
- Lime wedges for serving

### Instructions:

1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to create the marinade.
    
2. Place the flank steak in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish, and pour the marinade over it. Make sure the steak is well-coated. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or for more flavor, refrigerate it for a few hours or overnight.
    
3. Heat a skillet or pan over medium-high heat with a bit of vegetable oil.
    
4. Remove the steak from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Season the steak with additional salt and pepper.
    
5. Cook the steak in the hot skillet for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until nicely seared and cooked to your desired level of doneness. Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes.
    
6. In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed, and saut√© the sliced onions until they are soft and caramelized.
    
7. Shred the cooked flank steak using two forks or your hands.
    
8. Return the shredded beef to the pan with the caramelized onions and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the meat to crisp up a bit.
    
9. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired, and serve with lime wedges.
