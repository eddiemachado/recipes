But we can show photos of Javi eating his Penne in a bunch of situations.



One of Javi's favorite meals, this is an easy to make Penne pasta that kids will love, takes only a few minutes to make, and tastes way better than that store bought pasta sauce.

## Instructions

### Prep work
1. Blend your **carrots**, **celery**, **garlic**, and **onions** in your food processor to create your Battuto. Make sure it's blended into a nice paste, you don't want big chunks so the kids can't tell there's veggies in their pasta
2. Start boiling your **penne pasta** in a pot. You don't need to add oil or salt to the water [^one] 

### Preparation

1. Throw your **Battuto** mix into a pan with some **olive oil** and cook for about 5-10 minutes until things start to look a bit translucent
2. 


This goes great with some toasted bread or over some white rice.
