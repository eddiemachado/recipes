This is known as Gampy's chicken or abuelo's chicken.

#### Ingredients:

- 3 pounds chicken thighs, cut into serving pieces
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- (Bohio)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)
- sazon
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup green olives, pitted and sliced
- 2 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish

#### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
    
    - In a bowl, marinate the chicken pieces with lime juice, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for about 30 minutes.
2. **Brown the Chicken:**
    
    - In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken pieces on all sides. Remove the chicken and set it aside.
3. **Sauté Aromatics:**
    
    - In the same pot, sauté chopped onion and bell pepper until softened. Add minced garlic, ground cumin, dried oregano, and bay leaf. Cook for another minute until fragrant.
4. **Deglaze with Wine (Optional):**
    
    - If using white wine, pour it into the pot to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.
5. **Add Tomatoes and Broth:**
    
    - Stir in diced tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
6. **Return Chicken to the Pot:**
    
    - Return the browned chicken to the pot. Cover and let it simmer for about 30 minutes.
7. **Add Olives, Raisins, and Potatoes:**
    
    - Add sliced green olives, raisins, and potato chunks to the pot. Simmer for an additional 20-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.
8. **Adjust Seasoning and Garnish:**
    
    - Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley before serving.

Serve the Fricasé de Pollo over rice or with crusty bread. The combination of savory chicken, olives, and sweet raisins makes for a delightful and comforting dish.
