This easy to make tapenade goes great with some fresh bread or crackers. Again, it's important that you use really good honey as it will impact the taste if you buy the cheap stuff.

Most honey in supermarkets is filtered or cut[^one] with brown sugar so there's not even actual pollen[^two] in it. Buy local raw honey at the farmers market to ensure you're getting the good stuff[^three].

## Instructions

### Prep work
1. Clean the figs and make sure the stalks and skins are removed

### Preparation

1. Blend everything in your **food processor** in small bursts. It's important not to over mix, you want it to be nice and chunky
2. Put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes to an hour before serving so the flavors can come together a bit
3. Serve with lightly toasted bread or crackers



You can keep this in the fridge for a few days in a sealed container.
